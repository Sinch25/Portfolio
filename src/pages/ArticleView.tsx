Have you been to any hackathons? If not, then you definitely must try your hand at them.

Hackathons are a great way to showcase your coding and creative skills. They promote collaboration and patience. They can sound pretty intimidating, but the best part — you can participate without having to be a pro developer or a coding genius, which is what most likely happens in hackathons today.

I had been to a hackathon in IIT-Dharwad in February 2025, and I was pretty excited as that was my first. I had been looking up many hackathons and gathering various skills to take part in them. Every time my mother heard the word "hackathon", she couldn't quite place what we were trying to 'hack' exactly. So, I'm writing this article to break down what a hackathon is, generally, and how it works. Which brings us to the question of this article:

What are hackathons?

The word Hackathon is so commonly used in today’s technological sphere that no one realises it was coined by mixing two words — hack and marathon, where "hack" is used in the sense of exploratory programming.
Basically, a hackathon is a skill-based competitive event or festival where participants are asked to solve a problem and build solutions in a relatively short time frame. It typically involves developing software, creating an application, or brainstorming ideas to solve the problem.

Hackathons are often hosted by companies, schools, and organisations as a way to challenge participants to think creatively, inspire innovation, and generate project submissions.

The event can be 24 hours long, 36 hours long, or even a week!

During a hackathon, participants form teams and work on projects using programming languages and other tools to create mobile apps, websites, or other software solutions. The goal is usually to come up with a working prototype or demo by the end of the event.

At the end of a hackathon, project entries are reviewed by a panel of judges and the winner is awarded a prize.

History

 The origin of the modern-day hackathon, also known as a hack day or hackfest, goes back to 1999 when OpenBSD organised a cryptographic development event in Alberta on June 4. The name “hackathon” was coined by Niels Provos from OpenBSD.
Around the same time, Sun Microsystems organised the JavaOne Conference, where attendees were challenged to write a Java program for the new Palm V personal digital assistant (PDA). Soon enough, there were plenty of hackathon events being held per year by other organisations, mostly universities.

Join the Hackathon Craze: What’s In It for You?

Too often, we create what we are told to create, not what we want to create; therefore, by joining hackathons, you get the freedom to pitch your original ideas and creations.
To all the under-appreciated designers, you get to bring a whole new perspective, a whole new colour to the game. Dazzling visuals, user-centric designs, and an uncanny knack for creating a killer user experience.
Other than flaunting your tech skills, you get to network, meet new people, learn what it takes to be a team player, and learn from the whole experience as well.
The biggest benefits are having fun while experimenting and boosting your CV while you're at it!

Conclusion

Don't be scared to put yourself out there and participate in hackathons. Give it a shot and take back as much as you can from the experience :)
Well, this was a pretty brief explanation about hackathons, but yes, whenever someone asks what exactly you will be 'hacking' the next weekend, just show them this article!

    content: `"What am I doing here?" "What difference does my existence make in this world?" "Why am I the way I am?" "What is my purpose?" The list of questions goes on and on. Ever wondered why sometimes thoughts like these randomly pop up in your brain just from nowhere? These thoughts are very much common among people all around the world and signify an existential crisis.

An existential crisis is a period of questioning and contemplation about the meaning of life and one's own existence. The person might feel disconnected from the world and experiences feelings of inner emptiness and self-doubt. This can trigger anxiety, stress and depression. People might feel like they just don't fit in anywhere and they just find it difficult to go about their daily lives and work.

An existential crisis can be triggered by various factors like depression, anxiety, stressful life events, traumatic experiences, etc. When you are going through something similar to this, don't panic, it is normal. Talk to your friends, family or anybody who you trust. Seek professional help if required. Practise positive thinking and mindfulness. Your thoughts can make you strive better or leave you in distress. So always try to stay optimistic. Everything might seem overwhelming and unattainable for a while, but you will get through it. Trust me, you're gonna make it.`,

    content: `Music. A beautiful form of sound that brings various people together. Music reaches hearts like none other. When you unexpectedly meet somebody at a concert vibing to the same music as you, it stems feelings of closeness and connection. When people listen to their favourite songs together, something remarkable happens in the brain- "neural responses synchronize". This synchronization known as "neural entertainment" is a key factor in why shared musical activities often lead to stronger social bonds.


Impact of Music on Healing 

Growing evidence suggests, that listening to Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major and can reduce the frequency of seizures in some people with epilepsy. So beautiful, isn't it?
Other conditions and diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to depression to Alzheimer's, could someday have therapeutic solutions derived from an understanding of music. For instance, by identifying the exact type of music able to provoke a particular cognitive, motor, or emotional response, there could be progress toward healing, improving, or compensating for disrupted brain function in various diseases. An increased understanding of brain mechanisms can facilitate this.


Impact of Music on Memory 

Music can help retain essential information despite memory loss. Music memory is stored in the hippocampus, centrally located in the brain. Therefore, music memories are less likely to be negatively impacted by age or disease.
A musical mnemonic device is a natural way to memorize and recall information. As children, we learn various academic and social concepts through songs. Similarly, these memory strategies are highly effective for adults. In fact, our brains automatically "fill in the gaps" when a song suddenly stops.
Music therapists often incorporate these techniques with individuals to improve memory retention or developmental learning goals. Music may activate memories and remind us of places, events or people. A familiar tune may elicit the emotions associated with those memories.


Impact of Music on Metal Health 

Music can provide comfort and solace during times of distress, allowing us to express our feelings without having to put them into words. Music can also be used as a tool for self-reflection, helping us gain insight into our own experiences and find meaning in difficult situations.
Music has been found to be particularly beneficial for those who are grieving or suffering from trauma or PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Listening to certain types of music can evoke memories of happier times, providing a sense of hope and optimism even when faced with difficult circumstances.


Impact of Music on Behaviour 

Have you found yourself singing or listening to your go-to songs while performing boring, tiresome and tedious tasks? This is mostly due to the fact that music can be a motivator, a time for completing tasks or a mood enhancer. Music can validate your current emotional state and influence your emotional destination.
Overall, music is a bewitching and elegant tool for self-expression, recognition and connection.
Our lives are all shaped by music and always will be.`,

    content: `Reporting from the Frontlines – Spain, 17th April 1938

For this article, I stepped into the shoes of a 1930s-era war correspondent, transporting myself and my team back to Easter Sunday, 17th April 1938, at the height of the Spanish Civil War. My goal was to recreate the front page of a newspaper from that era, dated Monday, 18 April 1938, capturing the raw emotion, chaos, and humanity of the battlefield in real time — as if it had just happened.

In this edition, I aimed to bring first-hand coverage of the most pressing events that defined the day:

The fate of countless refugees, displaced and desperate, seeking shelter amidst relentless conflict.

A tense and bloody skirmish at the pontoon bridge on the River Ebro, a strategic choke point that witnessed fierce resistance and loss.

The brutal artillery shelling of San Carlos, shaking the very ground and lives of those caught within its blast radius.

The steady and ominous advance of Fascist forces, changing the tide of war as fear spread through Republican strongholds.

The constant threat from above — enemy planes flying in squadrons, the drone of engines and whine of sirens a chilling soundtrack to war.

And in sharp contrast, flickers of Easter celebrations, clung to by civilians as a fragile symbol of hope and resilience amidst devastation.`,
